# Quick Start

Let's get hands-on with WalletAgent! This guide will walk you through your first Web3 operations using prompts.

## Your First 10 Minutes with WalletAgent

Follow along with these examples to understand how WalletAgent works. All commands use safe mock wallets - no real funds involved!

### Step 1: Check Your Setup

First, let's verify WalletAgent is working:

```
Get wallet info
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Current wallet configuration:
- Type: mock
- Available addresses: 3
  - 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
  - 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
  - 0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Mock Mode**: WalletAgent starts in mock mode by default. This uses pre-configured test wallets that are completely safe for learning and development.
{% endhint %}

### Step 2: Connect to a Wallet

Connect to one of the pre-configured test wallets:

```
Connect to 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Connected to wallet: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
Chain: 31337
```

**What just happened?**
- You connected to a mock wallet with 10,000 test ETH
- The wallet is on the Anvil local testnet (Chain ID 31337)
- You're ready to send transactions!

### Step 3: Check Your Balance

Verify your wallet balance:

```
Check my balance
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Balance: 10000.0 ETH
Raw: 10000000000000000000000 wei
```

### Step 4: Send Your First Transaction

Send some test ETH to another address:

```
Send 1 ETH to 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Transaction sent successfully
Hash: 0x1234567890abcdef...
```

**Congratulations.** You just sent your first Web3 transaction using prompts.

### Step 5: Switch Chains

WalletAgent supports multiple blockchain networks. Let's switch to Polygon:

```
Switch to Polygon
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Switched to Polygon (Chain ID: 137)
```

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Use prompts instead of function calls
- **State Management**: Maintains wallet, chain, and contract context  
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Transaction details, gas costs, and error diagnostics
- Next step suggestions

## Exploring Token Operations

Let's try some token operations. First, switch back to Anvil which has pre-configured test tokens:

```
Switch to Anvil
```

### Check Token Balance

```
Get my USDC balance
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Token Balance:
Amount: 1000.0 USDC
Raw: 1000000000
Decimals: 6
```

### Transfer Tokens

```
Transfer 100 USDC to 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Token transfer successful
Transaction hash: 0xdef456789abcdef...
Token: USDC
To: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
Amount: 100.0
```

## Smart Contract Interaction

One of WalletAgent's most powerful features is contract interaction. Let's explore:

### Load Contract Configuration

If you have contract configuration files:

```
Load my contract configuration for AI interactions
```

### Simulate Contract Calls

Test contract functions without spending gas:

```
Read USDC contract balanceOf function with account 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Contract read successful:
Result: 900000000
Contract: USDC
Function: balanceOf
```

This is **very useful** for development - you can test any contract function without spending gas or affecting blockchain state.

### Step 7: Hyperliquid Support (Optional)

For users interested in decentralized trading, WalletAgent includes Hyperliquid integration for perpetual futures:

```
Import my Hyperliquid wallet using private key
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hyperliquid wallet imported successfully
Address: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

**Try Some Trading Commands:**
```
Show my Hyperliquid account balance and positions
Get current mid prices for BTC and ETH on Hyperliquid
Place a small test order: buy 0.001 BTC at market price
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Professional Trading**: Hyperliquid tools enable institutional-grade perpetual futures trading with AI assistance. Always start with small amounts on testnet!
{% endhint %}

## What You've Learned

In just 10 minutes, you've learned to:

- ‚úÖ Connect to wallets using prompts
- ‚úÖ Send transactions between addresses  
- ‚úÖ Switch between different blockchain networks
- ‚úÖ Transfer tokens with simple commands
- ‚úÖ Simulate smart contract calls

## Essential Command Patterns

Here are the key patterns you'll use constantly:

### Wallet Management
```
Connect to [address]
Check my balance  
Get current account
Switch to [chain name]
```

### Transactions
```
Send [amount] ETH to [address]
Transfer [amount] [token] to [address]
Get transaction status [hash]
```

### Contract Operations  
```
Simulate [function] for [contract] with [args]
Read contract [contract] function [function]
Write contract [contract] function [function] with args [args]
```

### Information & Analysis
```
Get [token] balance
List available contracts
Analyze [contract] capabilities
What chains are supported?
```

## Mock vs Real Wallets

You've been using **mock wallets** - completely safe test accounts. When you're ready for testnet development, you can switch to **real wallets**:

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Only use testnets!** Never use real wallets with mainnet funds. WalletAgent is beta software.
{% endhint %}

### Mock Wallets (Current)
- ‚úÖ Completely safe for learning
- ‚úÖ Pre-funded with test tokens
- ‚úÖ No setup required
- ‚ùå Can't interact with real testnets

### Real Wallets (Advanced)  
- ‚úÖ Works with testnets like Sepolia
- ‚úÖ Real blockchain interactions
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-grade encrypted private key storage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires testnet ETH for gas

#### Quick Encrypted Key Setup

For maximum security, use WalletAgent's encrypted keystore:

**1. Create Encrypted Keystore:**
```
Create encrypted keystore for secure testnet operations
```

**2. Import Your Testnet Private Key:**
```
Import private key with label 'Sepolia Testing'
```

**3. Switch to Encrypted Mode:**
```
Switch to private key wallet mode
Connect to my encrypted wallet address
```

**4. Verify Setup:**
```
Check keystore status
Get current account information
```

Now you can perform real blockchain operations with maximum security!
