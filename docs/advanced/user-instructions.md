# User Instructions

Creating custom user instructions and workflows for AI agents using Wallet Agent.

## Overview

User instructions enable individual developers to create standardized workflows, custom prompts, and specialized procedures for AI agents. This guide covers creating effective user instructions that leverage Wallet Agent's capabilities while maintaining consistency across different AI agent platforms.

**ðŸŽ¯ Customization Goal:** Create reusable, personalized instructions that make AI agents more effective at blockchain operations while reducing repetitive explanations.

## Understanding User Instructions

### What Are User Instructions?

User instructions are structured guidelines that:
- Define standard workflows for blockchain operations
- Establish project-specific terminology and procedures
- Create reusable prompts for common tasks
- Ensure consistency across different AI agents
- Reduce setup time for new development environments

### When to Create User Instructions

**Development Scenarios:**
- "Create standard instructions for my DeFi protocol interactions"
- "Set up consistent token deployment procedures for my projects"
- "Establish security protocols for mainnet operations"
- "Define testing workflows for smart contract development"

## Types of User Instructions

### Workflow Instructions

Standard procedures for common blockchain operations:

**Token Operations Workflow:**
```
When deploying ERC-20 tokens:
1. Always start with mock wallet testing
2. Deploy to Sepolia testnet first
3. Verify contract on block explorer
4. Test all token functions thoroughly
5. Only deploy to mainnet after thorough testing
6. Use secure wallet for initial token distribution
```

**DeFi Protocol Interaction:**
```
For interacting with our liquidity protocol:
1. Check current gas prices before operations
2. Simulate all transactions before execution
3. Use 10% slippage tolerance for DEX operations
4. Always approve exact amounts, never unlimited
5. Monitor positions after each interaction
```

### Security Instructions

Project-specific security protocols and procedures:

**Private Key Management:**
```
Personal security protocol:
- Development: Use Anvil default keys only
- Staging: Use testnet-specific keys with limited funds
- Production: Use encrypted keys with careful consideration
- Never share private keys in any communication
- All mainnet operations require careful review
```

**Transaction Approval Process:**
```
For high-value transactions:
1. Simulate transaction and review gas costs
2. Document transaction details for personal records
3. Double-check all parameters
4. Execute when you can monitor the transaction
5. Monitor transaction until confirmed
6. Document completion for future reference
```

### Custom Terminology

Project-specific terms and conventions:

**Contract Naming:**
```
Project contract naming conventions:
- Counter contracts: Use "ProjectCounter" naming
- Token contracts: Use "ProjectToken" format
- Always include version numbers in contract names
- Use consistent ABI generation paths: ./src/generated.ts
```

**Network References:**
```
Development network terminology:
- "dev" = Anvil local network (chainId: 31337)
- "staging" = Sepolia testnet (chainId: 11155111)
- "prod" = Ethereum mainnet (chainId: 1)
- "side" = Polygon mainnet (chainId: 137)
```

## Creating Effective Instructions

### Structure and Format

**Clear Action Steps:**

Steps:
1. "Load my NFT contract configuration from ./contracts/generated.ts"
2. "Estimate gas for minting 10 NFTs to address 0x..."
3. "Simulate the mint transaction before executing"
4. "Execute the mint with confirmed gas settings"
5. "Verify NFTs appear in recipient wallet"

Post-Mint:

Deployment Check:
"Verify all my smart contracts are deployed correctly on [network], check contract verification status, and confirm all contract functions are working"
```

**Emergency Procedures:**
```
Security Incident Response:
"Immediately check balances on all networks, show recent transaction history, identify any unauthorized transactions, and prepare asset migration to backup wallets"
```

### Integration Patterns
