## Security Architecture

### Encryption Details

**Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM
- Industry-standard symmetric encryption
- Authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)
- Provides both confidentiality and authenticity
- Resistant to padding oracle attacks

**Key Derivation:** PBKDF2
- 100,000 iterations (OWASP recommended minimum)
- SHA-256 hash function
- Unique salt per keystore
- Protects against rainbow table attacks

**Individual Key Encryption:**
- Each private key encrypted separately
- Unique initialization vector (IV) per key
- Key-specific additional authenticated data (AAD)
- Prevents cross-key vulnerabilities

### Session Management

**Automatic Timeout:**
- 30-minute session duration
- Automatic lock after inactivity
- Keys cleared from memory on timeout
- Manual lock available anytime

**Memory Security:**
- Decrypted keys stored in secure memory
- Immediate cleanup on session end
- No swap or disk caching
- Protected against memory dumps

### File Security

**Keystore File:**
- Restrictive file permissions (600)
- Stored in user-specific directory
- Integrity verification on load
- Atomic write operations

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# Create keystore for development
"Create encrypted keystore for development use"
"Import development private key with label 'Dev Testing'"
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash
# Create production keystore
"Create encrypted keystore with strong master password"
"Import private key from PROD_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable with label 'Production Main'"
"Lock keystore when not in use"
```

### Security Best Practices

**Master Password Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Minimum 12 characters (8 is technical minimum)
- ‚úÖ Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- ‚úÖ Unique to this application
- ‚úÖ Not based on personal information
- ‚úÖ Stored in secure password manager

**Operational Security:**
- ‚úÖ Always lock keystore after operations
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for private key input
- ‚úÖ Regular password rotation (quarterly)
- ‚úÖ Monitor session timeouts
- ‚úÖ Backup keystore with separate password storage

**Access Control:**
- ‚úÖ Restrict keystore file permissions
- ‚úÖ Use dedicated service accounts
- ‚úÖ Implement audit logging
- ‚úÖ Regular security reviews

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup
```
"Create encrypted keystore for production use"
"Import my private key from MAIN_WALLET_KEY environment variable"
"List my encrypted keys to confirm import"
"Lock keystore for security"
```

### Daily Operations
```
"Check keystore status"
"Unlock encrypted keystore for trading session"
"Connect to wallet using encrypted private key"
[Perform blockchain operations]
"Lock keystore when finished"
```

### Key Management
```
"List all encrypted keys with labels"
"Import additional private key with label 'Backup Wallet'"
"Update label for key 0x... to 'Main Trading Account'"
"Remove old encrypted key that's no longer needed"
```

### Security Maintenance
```
"Change keystore master password for security rotation"
"Check keystore status and session timeout"
"Lock keystore immediately for security"
```

## Integration with Wallet Operations

### Seamless Wallet Connection

Once keys are stored in encrypted keystore:

1. **Unlock Session:**
   ```
   "Unlock my encrypted keystore"
   ```

2. **Switch to Encrypted Keys:**
   ```
   "Switch to private key wallet mode"
   "Connect to my encrypted wallet address"
   ```

3. **Normal Operations:**
   ```
   "Send 1 ETH to 0x..."  # Uses encrypted private key transparently
   "Check my balance"      # Shows balance for encrypted key address
   ```

### Multi-Key Management

Manage multiple encrypted keys:

```
"List my encrypted keys"               # See all stored keys
"Connect to encrypted key labeled 'Trading'"  # Connect to specific key
"Switch to encrypted key for address 0x..."   # Connect by address
```

## Error Handling

### Session Management Errors

**Keystore Locked:**
```
Error: "Key store is locked. Use unlock_keystore first."
Solution: "Unlock my encrypted keystore with master password"
```

**Session Timeout:**
```
Error: "Session has expired. Please unlock keystore again."
Solution: "Unlock encrypted keystore to renew session"
```

### Password Errors

**Invalid Master Password:**
```
Error: "Invalid master password"
Solution: Verify password and try again, or use password recovery if available
```

**Weak New Password:**
```
Error: "New password must be at least 8 characters"
Solution: Choose a stronger password meeting security requirements
```

### Key Management Errors

**Key Already Exists:**
```
Error: "A key for this address is already stored"
Solution: Update existing key or use remove/re-import workflow
```

**Key Not Found:**
```
Error: "No encrypted key found for address"
Solution: Verify address and check list of available keys
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Lost Master Password

{% hint style="danger" %}
**No Password Recovery Available**
If you lose your master password, encrypted keys cannot be recovered. This is a fundamental security feature - no backdoors exist.
{% endhint %}

**Prevention:**
- Store master password in secure password manager
- Use memorable but strong passwords
- Consider password recovery hints (stored separately)
- Regular password testing in development

### Corrupted Keystore

**File Corruption:**
```
Error: "Invalid keystore format" or "Decryption failed"
```

**Recovery Options:**
- Restore from backup if available
- Re-create keystore with new master password
- Re-import private keys from secure sources
- Contact support if data recovery tools are needed

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Trail

**Operations Logged:**
- Keystore creation and unlocking
- Key import and removal operations
- Session timeouts and manual locks
- Password change operations

**Log Information:**
- Timestamp of all operations
- Key addresses (not private keys)
- Operation success/failure status
- Session duration information

### Compliance Features

**SOX Compliance:**
- Audit trails for all key operations
- Access control documentation
- Password policy enforcement
- Segregation of duties support

**ISO 27001:**
- Encryption standard compliance
- Key lifecycle management

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Session Timeouts

While 30 minutes is the default, session timeout can be configured based on security requirements:

- **High Security**: 5-10 minutes for maximum security
- **Standard**: 30 minutes for balanced security/usability
- **Development**: Extended timeouts for debugging (not recommended for production)

### Integration with HSMs

For enterprise environments requiring Hardware Security Module integration:

- Keystore can be configured to use HSM for master key derivation
- Private keys remain encrypted even within HSM environment
- Provides additional tamper resistance and compliance capabilities

### Multi-User Keystore

For team environments:

- Individual keystores per user
- Shared keystore with role-based access
- Audit trails per user for compliance
- Separate master passwords for access control
