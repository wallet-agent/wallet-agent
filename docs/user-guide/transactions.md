# Transactions

Learn how to send transactions, manage gas fees, and monitor transaction status using WalletAgent.

## Sending ETH/Native Tokens

### Basic ETH Transfer

Send ETH to another address:

```
Send 1 ETH to 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
```

**Example Output:**
```
Transaction sent successfully
Hash: 0xabc123def456789abcdef...
```

### Send to Short Address

Use abbreviated addresses for convenience:

```
Send 0.5 ETH to 0x7099
```

WalletAgent will find the matching address automatically.

### Send with Custom Gas

Specify gas parameters for better control:

```
Send 2 ETH to 0x3C44 with fast gas
```

**Gas Speed Options:**
- `slow` - Lowest cost, longer wait
- `standard` - Balanced cost and speed (default)
- `fast` - Higher cost, faster confirmation
- `fastest` - Highest cost, immediate confirmation

## Transaction Monitoring

### Get Transaction Status

Check the status of any transaction:

```
Get transaction status 0xabc123def456...
```

**Example Output:**
```
Transaction Status:
- Hash: 0xabc123def456...
- Status: confirmed
- From: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
- To: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
- Value: 1.0 ETH
- Block Number: 1234
```

### Get Transaction Receipt

Get detailed transaction information:

```
Get transaction receipt 0xabc123def456...
```

**Example Output:**
```
Transaction Receipt:
- Hash: 0xabc123def456...
- Status: success
- Block Number: 1234
- From: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
- To: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8
- Gas Used: 21000 units
- Effective Gas Price: 21.0 Gwei
- Total Cost: 0.000441 ETH
- Logs: 0 events
```

## Gas Management

### Estimate Gas Costs

Preview gas costs before sending transactions:

```
Estimate gas for sending 1 ETH to 0x7099
```

**Example Output:**
```
Gas Estimation:
- Estimated Gas: 21000 units
- Gas Price: 21.00 Gwei
- Estimated Cost: 0.000441 ETH
- Estimated Cost (Wei): 441000000000000
```


## Advanced Transaction Features

### Send with Specific Gas Parameters

Fine-tune gas settings for optimal results:

```
Send 1 ETH to 0x7099 with gas limit 25000 and gas price 30 gwei
```

### Send Maximum Amount

Send all available ETH (minus gas fees):

```
Send all ETH to 0x7099
```

**Example Output:**
```
üí∞ Sending Maximum Amount

üìä Calculation:
- Current Balance: 10000.0 ETH
- Estimated Gas Fee: 0.000441 ETH
- Amount to Send: 9999.999559 ETH

Proceeding with maximum transfer...
```

### Transaction with Data

Include custom data in transactions:

```
Send 0.1 ETH to 0x7099 with data "0x1234abcd"
```

This is useful for:
- Smart contract function calls
- Multi-signature wallets
- Custom transaction metadata

{% hint style="info" %}
**Transaction History**: WalletAgent currently doesn't include transaction history functionality. Use blockchain explorers or the transaction status/receipt tools to track specific transactions by hash.
{% endhint %}

## Multi-Chain Transactions

### Native Token Names by Chain

Each blockchain has its own native token:

| Chain | Native Token | Symbol |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Ethereum | Ether | ETH |
| Polygon | Polygon PoS | POL |
| Anvil | Ether | ETH |
| Sepolia | Sepolia Ether | ETH |

### Send on Different Chains

Switch chains and send native tokens:

```
Switch to Polygon
Send 10 POL to 0x7099
```

```
Switch to Sepolia  
Send 0.1 ETH to 0x3C44
```

### Cross-Chain Considerations

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: WalletAgent doesn't support cross-chain transfers directly. To send tokens from Ethereum to Polygon, you need:

1. Use a bridge service (like Polygon PoS Bridge)
2. Send to your own address on the destination chain
3. Never send ETH directly to Polygon addresses
{% endhint %}

## Error Handling

### Common Transaction Errors

**Insufficient Balance**
```
‚ùå Transaction Failed: Insufficient Balance

üí∞ Required: 10.5 ETH (10.0 ETH + 0.5 ETH gas)
üí∞ Available: 9.2 ETH  
üí∞ Shortfall: 1.3 ETH

üîß Solutions:
- Reduce amount: "Send 8.7 ETH to 0x7099"
- Get more ETH: "How do I get testnet ETH?"
- Use different wallet: "Connect to 0x3C44"
```

**Gas Limit Too Low**
```
‚ùå Transaction Failed: Out of Gas

‚õΩ Gas provided: 20,000
‚õΩ Gas needed: ~25,000
üìù Reason: Complex contract interaction

üîß Solutions:
- Increase gas limit: "Send with gas limit 30000"
- Use gas estimation: "Estimate gas for this transaction"
- Try default settings: Let WalletAgent estimate automatically
```

**Network Congestion**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction Pending: Network Congested

‚è±Ô∏è Submitted: 15 minutes ago
üîó Hash: 0xabc123...
‚õΩ Gas Price: 20 gwei (below current network average of 35 gwei)

üîß Options:
- Wait longer: Network will eventually process
- Speed up: "Replace transaction with higher gas"
- Cancel: "Cancel pending transaction"
```

### Transaction Recovery

**Replace Stuck Transaction**
```
Replace transaction 0xabc123... with higher gas price
```

**Cancel Pending Transaction**
```
Cancel transaction 0xabc123...
```

## Security Best Practices

### Before Sending Transactions

1. **Verify Recipient**: Double-check the address
   ```
   "Confirm this address: 0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8"
   ```

2. **Check Amount**: Ensure correct value
   ```
   "I want to send 1.5 ETH, not 15 ETH, correct?"
   ```

3. **Confirm Network**: Verify you're on the right chain
   ```
   "What chain am I currently on?"
   ```

### Transaction Verification

Always verify transaction details before confirming:
- ‚úÖ Recipient address is correct
- ‚úÖ Amount is as intended  
- ‚úÖ Gas fee is reasonable
- ‚úÖ You're on the correct network

### Mock vs Real Considerations

**In Mock Mode (Safe)**:
- ‚úÖ Unlimited funds for testing
- ‚úÖ No real money at risk
- ‚úÖ Perfect for learning transaction patterns

**In Real Mode (Testnet Only)**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use testnet ETH only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify addresses extra carefully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Start with small amounts
- ‚ùå **Never use on mainnet**

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Not Appearing

**Check Network**: Ensure you're on the correct chain
```
"What network am I on?"
"Switch to [correct network]"
```

**Verify Address**: Confirm address format and recipient
```
"Check transaction status 0x..."
"Get transaction receipt 0x..."  
```

### Transaction Failing

**Gas Issues**: Most common cause of transaction failures
```
"Estimate gas for [operation]"
"Send with higher gas limit"
```

**Balance Issues**: Insufficient funds for transaction + gas
```
"Check my balance"
"How much will gas cost?"
```

### Slow Confirmations

**Network Congestion**: Increase gas price for faster confirmation
```
"Replace transaction with fast gas"
"What's the current gas price?"
```
