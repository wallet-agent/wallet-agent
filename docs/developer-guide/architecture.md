# Development Concepts

This guide covers key concepts for building Web3 applications with Wallet Agent, focusing on development patterns and workflows that help you build better applications.

## Overview

Wallet Agent enables blockchain development through prompts with AI agents. Understanding these core concepts will help you work more effectively and build robust Web3 applications.

## Development Workflow

### Safe-First Development

Wallet Agent follows a **safety-first** approach to Web3 development:

**Mock Mode by Default**
- All operations start in mock mode for safe testing
- Switch to real wallets only when ready for production
- Built-in validation prevents costly mistakes

**Transaction Simulation**
- Test contract functions without gas costs using simulation
- Preview transaction outcomes before execution
- Catch errors before they cost money

**Multi-Environment Support**
- Develop locally with Anvil blockchain
- Test on Sepolia testnet
- Deploy to mainnet when ready

### AI-Native Development

**Prompt Interface**
Instead of complex API calls, use conversational prompts:
```
"Load my Wagmi config from ./src/generated.ts"
"Test the mint function on MyNFT contract with recipient 0x123..."
"Deploy MyToken to Sepolia with initial supply 1000000"
```

**Context-Aware Operations**
Wallet Agent remembers your:
- Current wallet connection
- Active blockchain network  
- Loaded contract configurations
- Recent transaction history

**Intelligent Error Handling**
Get clear explanations when things go wrong:
- Gas estimation failures with suggested fixes
- Contract interaction errors with context
- Network issues with retry suggestions

## Key Development Patterns

### Contract Development Lifecycle

**1. Design and Planning**
```
"Analyze the UniswapV2Router contract to understand the swap function"
"What are the standard functions for an ERC721 contract?"
"Extract the ABI from MyToken contract for frontend integration"
```

**2. Safe Development and Testing**
```
"Simulate the mint function before executing it"
"Test contract deployment on Anvil first"
"Generate comprehensive test scenarios for all contract functions"
```

**3. Deployment and Verification**
```
"Deploy MyContract to Sepolia with constructor args [name, symbol]"
"Verify the deployment by calling the name function"
"Estimate deployment costs for Ethereum mainnet"
```

**4. Integration and Maintenance**
```
"Generate TypeScript types from the deployed contract"
"Monitor contract events for Transfer activities"
"Update frontend hooks with new contract addresses"
```

### Multi-Chain Development

**Chain Abstraction**
Work with multiple blockchains seamlessly:
```
"Deploy MyContract to Polygon"
"Switch to Arbitrum and check gas prices"
"Compare deployment costs across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum"
```

**Network Configuration**
```
"Add Base network as a custom chain"
"Switch to Sepolia testnet for testing"
"Configure custom RPC endpoint for private network"
```

### Testing Strategies

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**
```
"Test all functions in MyContract with edge cases"
"Generate test scenarios for boundary conditions"
"Verify error handling with invalid inputs"
```

**Performance Testing**
```
"Run 50 concurrent balance queries to test system load"
"Measure gas usage optimization in contract functions"
"Test transaction throughput on different networks"
```

## Development Environment Setup

### Local Development

**Anvil Integration**
```bash
# Start local blockchain
anvil --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8545

# Connect Wallet Agent
"Switch to Anvil network"
"Connect to test wallet 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
```

**Project Integration**
```
"Load Wagmi configuration from ./src/generated.ts" 
"List all available contracts in my project"
"Analyze MyToken contract capabilities"
```

### Testnet Development

**Safe Testing Environment**
```
"Switch to Sepolia testnet"
"Import private key from environment variable TEST_PRIVATE_KEY"
"Deploy contracts with test parameters"
```

**Production Preparation**
```
"Estimate mainnet deployment costs"
"Review security checklist for production deployment"
"Generate deployment scripts for mainnet"
```

## Security Best Practices

### Development Security

**Always Start Safe**
- Begin all development in mock mode
- Use simulation before real transactions
- Test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet

**Key Management**
- Store private keys in environment variables
- Use encrypted key storage for production
- Never commit private keys to version control

**Input Validation**
```
"Validate address format before sending transaction"
"Check balance sufficiency before token transfers"
"Verify contract addresses before interactions"
```

### Production Security

**Comprehensive Testing**
- Test all contract functions and edge cases
- Verify error handling and recovery
- Perform security audits before deployment

**Monitoring and Maintenance**
```
"Set up transaction monitoring for deployed contracts"
"Monitor contract events for unusual activity"  
"Track gas usage and optimize performance"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Development Patterns

**Batch Operations**
```
"Check balances for multiple addresses simultaneously"
"Execute multiple token approvals in parallel"
"Query multiple contract functions at once"
```

**Caching and Reuse**
- Contract configurations are automatically cached
- RPC connections are pooled per network
- Frequently accessed data is optimized

**Network Optimization**
```
"Use multicall for batch contract reads"
"Optimize gas usage with transaction simulation"
"Choose optimal networks for different operations"
```

### Resource Management

**Memory Efficiency**
- Clean test environments between runs
- Automatic cleanup of temporary resources
- Efficient handling of large dataset operations

**Network Efficiency**
- Intelligent retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Connection pooling for blockchain RPC calls
- Optimized caching strategies

## Advanced Development Concepts

### Contract Interaction Patterns

**Read-Heavy Applications**
```
"Batch multiple view function calls for dashboard data"
"Cache frequently accessed contract state"
"Use multicall for efficient data aggregation"
```

**Write-Heavy Applications**
```
"Optimize transaction ordering for gas efficiency"
"Use transaction simulation to prevent failures"
"Implement proper nonce management for concurrent transactions"
```

### Cross-Chain Patterns

**Multi-Chain Deployment**
```
"Deploy identical contracts across Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum"
"Maintain consistent contract addresses across networks"
"Configure network-specific parameters for each deployment"
```

**Bridge Integration**

"Plan token bridge strategies for cross-chain liquidity"
"Design contracts for multi-chain compatibility"
"Implement cross-chain communication patterns"
```

## Troubleshooting and Debugging
