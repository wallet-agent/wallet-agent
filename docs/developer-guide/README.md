## Development Philosophy

Wallet Agent follows a **developer-first** approach:

### Safety-First Development

- **Mock Mode Default** - Safe testing environment for all experimentation
- **Contract Simulation** - Test functions without gas costs or state changes
- **Transaction Previews** - See exactly what will happen before execution
- **Comprehensive Validation** - Catch errors before they cost gas

### AI-Native Development

- **Prompts** - Code with conversational interfaces
- **Context Awareness** - AI understands your project structure and goals
- **Intelligent Suggestions** - Get recommendations based on best practices
- **Error Explanations** - Clear guidance when things go wrong

### Multi-Chain by Default

- **Chain Abstraction** - Write code once, deploy everywhere
- **Network Switching** - Seamlessly move between development and production
- **Cross-Chain Patterns** - Built-in support for multi-chain architectures
- **Custom Network Support** - Add any EVM-compatible blockchain

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup & Configuration

```
# Verify your Wallet Agent installation
Get wallet info
```

### 2. Project Integration

```
# Load your Wagmi configuration  
Load wagmi config from ./src/generated.ts

# Analyze your contracts
List all available contracts
Analyze MyContract contract capabilities
```

### 3. Safe Development

```
# Test contract functions safely
Test contract function mint for MyNFT
Simulate transfer function for MyToken
Dry run transaction: deploy MyContract
```

### 4. Deployment & Verification

```
# Deploy to testnet
Switch to Sepolia
Deploy MyContract with constructor args [arg1, arg2]
Verify deployment on Sepolia
```

## Key Features for Developers

### Contract Simulation Engine

Test any smart contract function without gas costs:

```
Simulate mint function for MyNFT with recipient 0x123... and tokenId 1
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero Gas Cost** - Test complex functions for free
- ‚úÖ **State Preservation** - Blockchain state remains unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Error Detection** - Catch reverts before execution
- ‚úÖ **Return Value Preview** - See function outputs

### Automated Test Generation

Generate comprehensive test scenarios automatically:

```
Test contract function transfer for MyToken
```

**Auto-Generated Tests:**
- Basic success scenarios with typical inputs
- Edge cases (zero values, maximum values)
- Boundary conditions (zero addresses, overflow)
- Error conditions with expected revert reasons

### Wagmi Integration

Seamlessly integrate with your existing Wagmi setup:

```
# Extract contract information
Extract ABI for MyToken in TypeScript format
List all view functions for MyContract
Export MyNFT ABI to ./abis/MyNFT.json

# Generate documentation
Analyze MyContract capabilities and detect standards
```

### Multi-Chain Development

Deploy and test across multiple networks:

```
# Test locally
Switch to Anvil
Deploy and test MyContract

# Test on testnet  
Switch to Sepolia
Deploy MyContract to testnet

# Prepare for mainnet
Switch to Ethereum
Estimate deployment costs
```

## Development Environment

### Recommended Setup

**Local Development:**
```
# Start Anvil for local testing
anvil --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8545

# Connect Wallet Agent
Switch to Anvil
Get test wallets from faucet
```

**Testing Pipeline:**
```
# Run comprehensive tests
Test all contract functions
Generate test coverage report
Verify all scenarios pass
```

**Deployment Pipeline:**
```
# Deploy to testnet
Switch to Sepolia
Deploy with test parameters
Verify contract functionality

# Prepare mainnet deployment  
Estimate mainnet costs
Review security checklist
Plan deployment strategy
```

### Required Tools

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun** - JavaScript runtime
- **Foundry/Anvil** - Local blockchain for testing
- **Wagmi CLI** - Contract ABI generation
- **AI Agent** - Claude Code or Cursor with MCP support

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro Tip**: Wallet Agent integrates with your existing development tools. You don't need to change your workflow - just add AI capabilities.

## Common Development Patterns

### Contract Development Lifecycle

1. **Design & Planning**
   ```
   # Analyze existing contracts for inspiration
   Analyze UniswapV2Router capabilities
   Extract patterns from successful protocols
   ```

2. **Implementation**
   ```
   # Write contracts using your favorite tools
   # Use Wallet Agent for testing and validation
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```
   # Generate comprehensive test suites
   Test all contract functions
   Generate edge case scenarios
   Verify security properties
   ```

4. **Deployment**
   ```
   # Deploy safely with preview and verification
   Dry run deployment to Sepolia
   Deploy with constructor verification
   Verify contract source code
   ```

### DApp Integration Patterns

1. **Frontend Integration**
   ```
   # Generate Wagmi hooks
   Extract ABI for MyContract in TypeScript
   Generate React hooks from ABI
   Test contract integration
   ```

2. **Backend Integration**
   ```
   # Monitor contract events
   Listen for Transfer events from MyToken
   Process transaction receipts
   Update database with blockchain state
   ```

3. **Multi-Chain Support**
   ```
   # Deploy across networks
   Deploy MyContract to Polygon
   Deploy MyContract to Arbitrum
   Configure cross-chain communication
   ```

## Security & Best Practices
