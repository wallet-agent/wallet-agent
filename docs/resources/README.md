- "Connect to my first wallet and check the balance"
- "Switch to Polygon network and check my POL balance"
- "Load my smart contract configuration"

**Transaction Operations:**
- "Send 0.1 ETH to address 0x742d35..."
- "Transfer 100 USDC tokens to Alice"
- "Estimate gas cost for this transaction"
- "Check the status of transaction 0xabc123..."

**Contract Interactions:**
- "Read the current value from my Counter contract"
- "Call the increment function on my contract"
- "Deploy my contract to Sepolia testnet"
- "Simulate this contract call before executing"

**Multi-Chain Operations:**
- "Add Arbitrum network to my available chains"
- "Compare gas costs on Ethereum vs Polygon"
- "Switch to Base network and check my balance"
- "Show me all supported blockchain networks"

### Error Messages Quick Guide

**Common Error Patterns:**
- `"No wallet connected"` → Connect a wallet first
- `"Insufficient funds"` → Check balance and gas requirements
- `"Contract not loaded"` → Load contract configuration
- `"Invalid address"` → Verify address format and checksum
- `"Network error"` → Check RPC connectivity and network status

### Performance Tips

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Use batch operations for multiple queries
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Choose optimal RPC endpoints
- Monitor and optimize gas usage
- Use simulation before expensive operations

**AI Agent Efficiency:**
